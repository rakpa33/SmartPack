## ‚ö†Ô∏è CLARIFYING QUESTIONS NEEDED

**IMPORTANT**: Some version history details may be extrapolated and need verification:

1. **Version Dates**: Are the specific dates (2025-07-26, 2025-07-27, etc.) accurate?
2. **Feature Timeline**: Is the progression of features (Heroicons, AI system, etc.) accurate?
3. **Version Numbers**: Should we follow semantic versioning or a different scheme?
4. **Release Process**: Do you want formal releases or just development tracking?
5. **Breaking Changes**: Have there been any actual breaking changes in development?
