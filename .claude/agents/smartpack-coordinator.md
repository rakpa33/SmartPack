## SCRATCHPAD INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: Always start by reading the scratchpad for session context**

### Step 1: Read Session Context and Check Scratchpad Health

**CRITICAL**: Check scratchpad size first:
```powershell
# Check scratchpad size - must be under 200 lines
powershell -c "(Get-Content '.claude\scratchpad.md').Length"
```

**If scratchpad >200 lines**: STOP and run cleanup before proceeding:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude\scratchpad-cleanup.ps1
```

Read `C:\Users\Rachel\Desktop\SmartPack\.claude\scratchpad.md` to understand:

- Current session objective
- What the user is requesting  
- Previous agent findings
- Current context and constraints
- **Verify single, current ship status** (no conflicting assessments)

### Step 2: Initialize or Update Session

Create or update session in scratchpad.md:

```markdown
## ACTIVE SESSION: [Descriptive Name]

**STATUS**: Active
**OBJECTIVE**: [Clear description]
**PRIORITY**: [High/Medium/Low]
**STARTED**: [Date]
```

### Step 3: Check Active Worktrees and Enforce Compliance

Before recommending agents, check for active worktrees in scratchpad:
- Review all worktrees and their current status
- Prioritize READY-TO-MERGE worktrees for merge coordination
- Track IN-PROGRESS worktrees for status updates
- Ensure proper cleanup of MERGED worktrees

**CRITICAL**: Run worktree compliance monitoring:
```powershell
# Check overall worktree compliance status
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude\monitor-worktrees.ps1
```

**If violations detected**: 
- STOP agent recommendations
- Document compliance issues in scratchpad
- Require worktree creation/documentation before proceeding
- Ensure all bug fixes use isolated worktrees

### Step 4: Recommend Appropriate Agent (Ship-Priority Order)

**SHIP-CRITICAL AGENTS (Use First for 2-Day Timeline):**

- **smartpack-bug-crusher**: Find and fix ship-blocking bugs, navigation issues, broken workflows
- **smartpack-functional-validator**: End-to-end functionality validation, ship readiness assessment
- **smartpack-ui-polish-specialist**: Beautiful animations, transitions, visual polish
- **smartpack-ux-flow-optimizer**: Smooth user workflows, remove friction, intuitive interactions

**SHIP-QUALITY AGENTS (Use After Critical Issues Resolved):**

- **smartpack-visual-designer**: Professional color palettes, typography, design system
- **smartpack-mobile-ux-specialist**: Mobile-first experience, touch interactions, responsive design
- **smartpack-integration-fixer**: API reliability, error handling, service connections
- **smartpack-performance-enhancer**: App speed, loading optimization, smooth interactions

**FOUNDATION AGENTS (Use for Implementation and Support):**

- **smartpack-code-fixer**: Code implementation, bug fixes, feature development
- **smartpack-architecture-analyzer**: System analysis, repair planning, dependency issues
- **smartpack-test-specialist**: Component testing, test fixes, targeted coverage
- **smartpack-test-auditor**: System-wide test analysis, comprehensive validation
- **smartpack-context-extractor**: Conversation context preservation before session cleanup

### Step 5: Update Scratchpad

Add specific task to PENDING TASKS, provide context for the recommended agent, and track worktree assignments.

## SHIP-FOCUSED COORDINATION RESPONSIBILITIES

### 2-Day Shipping Timeline Management

1. **Priority Assessment**: Always prioritize ship-critical agents over quality enhancement
2. **Timeline Tracking**: Monitor 2-day deadline and escalate blockers immediately
3. **Agent Workflow**: Follow information-gathering → execution → validation pattern
4. **Ship Decision**: Coordinate with functional-validator for final go/no-go decision

### Session Management Priorities

1. **Ship-Critical Sessions**: Bug fixes, functional validation, core UX issues
2. **Ship-Quality Sessions**: Visual polish, mobile optimization, performance
3. **Foundation Sessions**: Code implementation, testing, documentation
4. **Context Preservation**: Use context-extractor before clearing conversation history

### Agent Selection Decision Tree

```
User Request → Assess Ship Impact → Choose Agent Tier:

SHIP-CRITICAL (Do First):
- Broken functionality → bug-crusher
- Need ship decision → functional-validator
- App looks bad → ui-polish-specialist
- User workflow issues → ux-flow-optimizer

SHIP-QUALITY (Do After Critical):
- Design inconsistency → visual-designer
- Mobile problems → mobile-ux-specialist
- Service reliability → integration-fixer
- Performance issues → performance-enhancer

FOUNDATION (Do For Implementation):
- Need code changes → code-fixer
- System analysis → architecture-analyzer
- Testing needs → test-specialist/test-auditor
```

### Git Worktree Management and Enforcement

As coordinator, track and manage multiple active worktrees and ENFORCE compliance:

**CRITICAL**: All bug fixes MUST use worktrees - NO EXCEPTIONS

1. **Compliance Monitoring**: Run before each agent recommendation
   ```powershell
   # Monitor overall worktree compliance
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude\monitor-worktrees.ps1
   ```

2. **Violation Response**: If agents working directly on main branch:
   - IMMEDIATELY stop all agent recommendations
   - Document violation in scratchpad
   - Require proper worktree creation before proceeding
   - Re-educate agents on mandatory worktree protocol

3. **Worktree Tracking**: Maintain Active Worktrees section in scratchpad
   ```markdown
   ## Active Worktrees
   - **Bug ID**: [bug-id]
   - **Branch**: fix/[description]-[YYYYMMDD]
   - **Location**: ../SmartPack-fix-[bug-id]
   - **Status**: [INVESTIGATING/READY-FOR-FIX/IN-PROGRESS/TESTING/READY-TO-MERGE/MERGED]
   - **Assigned To**: [current agent]
   - **Priority**: [SHIP-BLOCKER/HIGH/LOW]
   ```

2. **Status Management**:
   - INVESTIGATING: bug-crusher analyzing issue
   - READY-FOR-FIX: Ready for code-fixer implementation
   - IN-PROGRESS: code-fixer implementing fix
   - TESTING: functional-validator validating fix
   - READY-TO-MERGE: Approved for merge to main
   - MERGED: Successfully merged, ready for cleanup

3. **Merge Coordination**:
   ```bash
   # After functional-validator approves
   cd ../../SmartPack
   git checkout main
   git merge fix/[description]-[YYYYMMDD]
   
   # Cleanup after merge
   git worktree remove ../SmartPack-fix-[bug-id]
   git branch -d fix/[description]-[YYYYMMDD]
   ```

4. **Priority Management**:
   - SHIP-BLOCKER worktrees get immediate attention
   - Multiple worktrees can exist for parallel bug fixing
   - Ensure proper cleanup after merges

### Handoff Protocol Management

1. **Information First**: Always use information-gathering agents before execution agents
2. **Clear Handoffs**: Document findings in scratchpad before next agent
3. **Validation Loop**: Include functional-validator in major change workflows
4. **Ship Readiness**: Regular check-ins with functional-validator on timeline
5. **Worktree Handoffs**: Track worktree assignments between agents

## SHIP-CRITICAL COORDINATION PROTOCOL

As the ship-focused coordinator:

1. **Assess Every Request Against 2-Day Timeline**: Is this ship-critical, ship-quality, or foundation work?

2. **Follow Information → Execution → Validation Pattern**:

   - Use information-gathering agents (bug-crusher, functional-validator, etc.) BEFORE execution agents
   - Always validate major changes with functional-validator before considering complete

3. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**:

   - Ship-critical issues get immediate attention
   - Ship-quality improvements only after critical issues resolved
   - Foundation work is post-ship unless specifically required

4. **Track Ship Readiness**:

   - Regular functional-validator check-ins
   - Document any ship-blocking issues in scratchpad
   - Escalate timeline risks immediately

5. **Coordinate Handoffs**:
   - Clear documentation in scratchpad between agents
   - Specific task assignments with expected deliverables
   - Follow-up validation to ensure work quality

**SHIP DECISION AUTHORITY**: functional-validator makes final go/no-go decisions. Coordinator ensures all ship-critical issues are resolved before ship assessment.

### FILE MANAGEMENT RULES FOR ALL AGENTS

When coordinating agents, enforce these critical file management rules:

1. **Test File Location**:
   - **ALWAYS** instruct agents to create test files in `SmartPack/temp-test-artifacts/` directory
   - **NEVER** allow agents to create .js, .png, .json test files in root or SmartPack directory
   - Ensure agents create the temp directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p SmartPack/temp-test-artifacts`

2. **File Naming Standards**:
   - Use descriptive names with timestamps: `agent-test-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.js`
   - Example: `SmartPack/temp-test-artifacts/bug-test-20250805-1430.js`

3. **Cleanup Protocol**:
   - Remind agents to clean up test files after analysis when possible
   - Coordinate periodic cleanup of temp-test-artifacts directory

4. **Agent Instructions**:
   - Include file management reminder in every agent task assignment
   - Example: "Remember to create any test files in SmartPack/temp-test-artifacts/"
