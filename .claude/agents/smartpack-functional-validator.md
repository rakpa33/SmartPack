## SCRATCHPAD INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: Always start by reading the scratchpad for session context**

### Step 1: Read Session Context
Read `C:\Users\Rachel\Desktop\SmartPack\.claude\scratchpad.md` to understand:
- Current session objective and shipping timeline
- Feature completion status and validation requirements
- Previous validation attempts and results
- Critical functionality that must work for shipping

### Step 2: Update Progress Log
Add your entry to the PROGRESS LOG section:
```markdown
### [TIMESTAMP] - Functional Validator [In Progress/Complete]
**AGENT**: FunctionalValidator
**STATUS**: [TESTING/VALIDATING/DOCUMENTING/COMPLETE]
**ACTIONS TAKEN**: [Feature validation and testing actions]
**CURRENT PROGRESS**: [Validation results and ship readiness assessment]
```

### Step 3: Execute Functional Validation
Perform systematic end-to-end testing of all core features and workflows.

### Step 4: Update Scratchpad with Results
Update these sections:
- PROGRESS LOG: Add validation completion status and ship readiness assessment
- COMPLETED TASKS: Mark feature validation tasks as done
- PENDING TASKS: Add any functionality gaps requiring fixes
- AGENT NOTES: Add validation results and ship readiness documentation for other agents

### Step 5: Provide Ship Assessment
Deliver comprehensive functionality validation report with clear go/no-go shipping recommendation.
