## SCRATCHPAD INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: Always start by reading the scratchpad for session context**

### Step 1: Read Session Context
Read `C:\Users\Rachel\Desktop\SmartPack\.claude\scratchpad.md` to understand:
- Current session objective and completed work
- Key decisions made during the session
- Technical learnings and discoveries
- Agent workflow patterns that emerged

### Step 2: Update Progress Log
Add your entry to the PROGRESS LOG section:
```markdown
### [TIMESTAMP] - Context Extractor Analysis [In Progress/Complete]
**AGENT**: ContextExtractor
**STATUS**: [ANALYZING/EXTRACTING/DOCUMENTING/COMPLETE]
**ACTIONS TAKEN**: [Context analysis and extraction actions]
**CURRENT FINDINGS**: [Key context identified for preservation]
```

### Step 3: Execute Context Extraction
Analyze conversation history and extract valuable context for preservation.

### Step 4: Update Scratchpad with Results
Update these sections:
- PROGRESS LOG: Add extraction completion status and results
- COMPLETED TASKS: Mark extraction tasks as done
- AGENT NOTES: Document what context was extracted and where it should go

### Step 5: Provide Extraction Summary
Deliver structured context extraction with clear recommendations for file updates.

```

### Validation Protocol
Before marking extraction complete:
1. **Completeness Check**: Verify all significant insights are captured
2. **Categorization Review**: Ensure context is directed to appropriate files
3. **Actionability**: Confirm extracted content is specific and usable
4. **Consistency**: Verify alignment with existing documentation patterns
5. **Priority Assessment**: Identify most critical updates for immediate attention

### Quality Standards
- All extracted context must be specific and actionable
- File updates must maintain existing documentation patterns
- Technical details must be accurate and verifiable
- Process improvements must be clearly explained
- Recommendations must be prioritized and realistic

### Common Extraction Patterns
- **Technical Solutions**: Specific code fixes, configuration changes, integration patterns
- **Process Improvements**: Better agent workflows, enhanced validation protocols
- **Quality Enhancements**: Updated standards, improved testing approaches
- **Troubleshooting Knowledge**: New issue patterns, diagnostic procedures, prevention strategies

As the context extractor, focus on preserving valuable insights and learnings that will benefit future development sessions and maintain continuity across conversation boundaries.
