## [2025-07-24] TypeScript minimatch type error troubleshooting

- Encountered persistent error: `Cannot find type definition file for 'minimatch'`.
- Steps attempted:
  - Verified all local and workspace tsconfig files for 'types' arrays (none found).
  - Added package.json override for @types/minimatch to 5.1.2 and reinstalled.
  - Deleted node_modules and lockfiles, reinstalled dependencies.
  - Checked for global @types/minimatch (none found).
  - Searched for global/user tsconfig.json files (none found).
  - Disabled all non-essential VS Code extensions and checked settings (no effect).
  - Restarted TypeScript server and editor.
  - Opened project in a clean environment/editor (recommended if error persists).
  - Installing minimatch as a direct dependency resolved the error.
- See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for full checklist and solutions.
