# Onboarding Guide for SmartPack

Welcome! This guide will help you (or future contributors) get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS)
- npm
- AWS CLI (configured)
- Ollama (local/self-hosted, running)
- (Optional) AWS S3 bucket for frontend deployment

## Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values (see ENVIRONMENT.md)
4. **Start both development servers:**
   - Backend: `npm run lambda:dev` (runs on port 3000)
   - Frontend: `npm run dev` (runs on port 5173)
5. **Verify setup:**
   - Backend health: Visit `http://localhost:3000/health`
   - Frontend: Visit `http://localhost:5173`
6. Run tests: `npm test -- --run` or `npx playwright test`

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

1. Start backend: `npm run lambda:dev`
2. Start frontend: `npm run dev` (in separate terminal)
3. Both must be running for AI Suggestions to work
4. Test changes, run tests, commit

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: `npm test -- --run` (avoid watch mode for final verification)
- E2E tests: `npx playwright test`
- Manual testing: Test AI Suggestions panel with custom prompts
- Health check: Ensure backend responds at `http://localhost:3000/health`
