<!--
This file tracks high-level features, milestones, and tasks for SmartPack.
Keep this comment at the top; do not overwrite or remove it when updating the document.

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE RULES:
- Mirror ROADMAP.md phase/step hierarchy exactly
- Use sectioned organization: "📋 Planned" (from ROADMAP.md) and "✨ Enhanced Implementation" (beyond plan)
- Focus on high-level action tracking with cross-references to detailed documentation
- Convert deliverables into testable acceptance criteria
- Keep technical implementation details in DEVLOG.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, etc.

SECTIONED ORGANIZATION:
- 📋 Planned (from ROADMAP.md): Tasks directly from the original roadmap
- ✨ Enhanced Implementation: Additional value delivered beyond original scope

HOW TO UPDATE:
1. STEP COMPLETION: Mark entire step [x] ONLY when ALL sub-items are complete. Incomplete sub-items must be clearly marked [ ]
2. PLANNED vs ENHANCED: Keep expected ROADMAP.md implementation in 📋 Planned, scope extras in ✨ Enhanced
3. NEW PLANNED ITEMS: Can add to 📋 Planned if ROADMAP.md is updated with new requirements
4. NEW STEPS: Create new step numbers (e.g., Step 9.5) when predicting next steps from recent implementation
5. CROSS-REFERENCES: Use format "*See [DOCUMENT.md] (date) for [specific context]*"
6. BATCH UPDATES: Update references at major milestones (alert if tracking becomes problematic)
7. MULTI-DOC CHANGES: Update in order of detail level (DEVLOG.md → TROUBLESHOOTING.md → CHECKLIST.md)

FORMATTING RULES:
- Use 📋 for planned ROADMAP.md tasks, ✨ for enhanced implementation beyond scope
- Include brief outcome-focused descriptions with clear completion status
- Reference detailed docs for implementation specifics
- Maintain clear acceptance criteria for each step
- Ensure [ ] for incomplete work is clearly visible
