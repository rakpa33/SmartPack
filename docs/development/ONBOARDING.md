# Onboarding Guide for SmartPack

Welcome! This guide will help you (or future contributors) get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v20.14.0+ (LTS)
- **npm** 10.7.0+
- **Ollama** (local AI service)
  - Download from: https://ollama.ai/
  - Must have llama3.1:8b model installed
- **Modern Browser**: For Heroicons vector icon rendering and accessibility features
- **(Optional)** AWS CLI (configured) for deployment
- **(Optional)** AWS S3 bucket for frontend deployment
- **Testing Environment**: Playwright for E2E test execution

## Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install Ollama and AI model:**
   ```bash
   # Download Ollama from https://ollama.ai/
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b
   ollama serve  # Start service on port 11434
   ```
3. **Install project dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
4. **Copy environment configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Copy .env.example to .env and configure (see ENVIRONMENT.md)
   # Key variables: OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434, OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
   ```
5. **Start development environment:**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Ollama service (if not running as system service)
   ollama serve

   # Terminal 2: AI-integrated backend
   npm run lambda:dev

   # Terminal 3: Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Verify complete setup:**
   - **Ollama AI**: `http://localhost:11434` (service running)
   - **Backend Health**: `http://localhost:3000/health` (API ready)
   - **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173` (UI running)
   - **AI Integration Test**: Create trip and verify real AI-generated recommendations (not mock data)
   - **Professional UI Check**: Confirm Heroicons vector icons render properly
7. **Run comprehensive test suite:**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --run                    # Unit/Integration tests
   npx playwright test                   # E2E tests
   npm test -- enhancedAI               # AI-specific validation
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development Setup

1. **Verify Ollama**: `ollama list` (confirm llama3.1:8b available)
2. **Start AI-Integrated Backend**: `npm run lambda:dev`
3. **Start Professional UI Frontend**: `npm run dev` (separate terminal)
4. **Validate AI Integration**: Test that checklist generation uses real AI (not fallback)
5. **Verify Enhanced Features**: Test intelligent recommendations and professional icons
6. **Development Cycle**: Make changes â†’ Test AI integration â†’ Run test suite â†’ Commit

### Enhanced Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: `npm test -- --run` (enhanced AI logic and services)
- **Integration Tests**: `npm test -- enhancedAI.integration.test.tsx` (component interactions)
- **E2E Tests**: `npx playwright test` (full user workflows with intelligent AI)
- **Enhanced AI Validation**: Test context-aware recommendations vs. repetitive suggestions
- **Professional UI Testing**: Verify Heroicons icons render and accessibility compliance
- **Manual Testing**: Test AI Suggestions panel with varied trip scenarios
- **Health Check**: Ensure enhanced backend responds at `http://localhost:3000/health`
