# Kickoff Phase Template

**Kickoff Phase <PHASE_NUMBER> Step <STEP_NUMBER>**

Systematically initiate a new development phase with comprehensive planning and setup.

## 1. Initial Setup and Context

- Hi Copilot Chat. Please load and obey the rules above and follow the roadmap in `copilotdocs/ROADMAP.md`
- Check `copilotdocs/DEVLOG.md` for recent changes or context that might affect this phase
- Review `copilotdocs/CHECKLIST.md` for completed items and current progress
- Verify `copilotdocs/ENVIRONMENT.md` for setup requirements and configuration
- Ensure all prerequisites from previous phases are met

## 2. Phase Analysis

- Summarize objectives, planned files, and planned tests for this phase
- Reference relevant files for this step from the roadmap
- Analyze the scope and complexity of work required
- Identify potential challenges or risks for this phase
- Confirm phase aligns with overall project goals and timeline

## 3. Requirements and Dependencies

- State acceptance criteria for completion based on roadmap specifications
- List dependencies or prerequisites that must be satisfied
- Check for any blockers or issues in `copilotdocs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Verify all required tools and environment setup is complete
- Identify any external dependencies or integrations needed

## 4. Technical Planning

- Review `copilotdocs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for architecture and design patterns
- Consider best practices for the languages and frameworks used in the project
- Check `copilotdocs/COMMANDS.md` for relevant development commands and scripts
- Plan implementation approach considering existing codebase patterns
- Identify any new tools or dependencies that need to be added

## 5. Quality and Testing Strategy

- Review `copilotdocs/TESTING_GUIDELINES.md` for testing requirements and patterns
- Consider error handling strategies and edge cases
- Plan performance optimization opportunities
- Ensure accessibility and security requirements are addressed
- Define testing approach for unit, integration, and E2E tests

## 6. Documentation Planning

- Plan updates to `copilotdocs/CHECKLIST.md` to match `copilotdocs/ROADMAP.md`
- Prepare to document significant decisions or setup requirements in `copilotdocs/DEVLOG.md`
- Identify architecture documentation updates needed
- Plan for code comments and inline documentation
- Consider README or setup documentation updates

## 7. Implementation Strategy

- Break down the phase into logical steps and milestones
- Plan the order of implementation for optimal development flow
- Each checklist item should clearly describe steps and validation tests
- Identify opportunities for parallel development work
- Plan for incremental progress with regular validation checkpoints

## 8. Risk Management

- Identify potential technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Plan fallback approaches for complex implementations
- Consider timeline risks and contingency plans
- Identify areas where external help or research might be needed

## Final Action

State the first action item to execute **Phase <PHASE_NUMBER> Step <STEP_NUMBER>** and only wait for user confirmation before writing code.

## Usage

Replace `<PHASE_NUMBER>` and `<STEP_NUMBER>` with actual values when using this prompt.
