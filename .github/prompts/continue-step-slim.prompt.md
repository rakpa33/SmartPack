# Continue Development

Continue SmartPack development from current state.

## Quick Context Check

**Current State:**

- Check CHECKLIST.md for current step and progress
- Review DEVLOG.md for recent changes and context
- Scan TROUBLESHOOTING.md for any active blockers

## Development Flow

### 1. Identify Next Action

- Current development phase from ROADMAP.md
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Immediate priorities vs long-term goals

### 2. Pre-Development Validation

```bash
# Environment check
npm run build && npm run lint

# Quick test validation
npm test -- --run --timeout=10000
```

### 3. Implementation Approach

- Follow established SmartPack patterns
- Maintain code quality standards (TS strict, accessibility)
- Use incremental development with frequent validation
- Update documentation for significant changes

### 4. Quality Gates

- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] Tests pass for affected components
- [ ] Accessibility compliance maintained
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design preserved

## Focus Areas

**Architecture**: Follow component patterns in smartpack-development.instructions.md
**Testing**: Use protocols in smartpack-testing.instructions.md  
**Documentation**: Update following smartpack-documentation.instructions.md

## Next Steps Identification

Based on current progress:

- Continue current step implementation
- Address any blockers in TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Move to next ROADMAP.md phase if current complete
- Suggest testing or deployment if implementation ready
