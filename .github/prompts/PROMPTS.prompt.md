- **Table of Contents:**
  - Kickoff Phase <PHASE_NUMBER> Step <STEP_NUMBER>:
  - Proceed with Phase <PHASE_NUMBER> Step <STEP_NUMBER>:
  - Approved. Generate code and tests.
  - Troubleshoot Failing Tests:
  - Prepare Commit and Checklist Update:
  - Refresh Project Context:
  - Propose Deviation or Scope Change:
  - Request New Feature:
  - End-of-Day Wrap-up:
  - Custom Request for Phase <PHASE_NUMBER> Step <STEP_NUMBER>:
- **Each section includes bullets for:**
  - Referencing relevant files
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Dependencies/prerequisites
  - User confirmation
  - Documentation updates (where relevant)
  - Rollback plan or summary of changes (where relevant)
- **Project Rules:** Copilot will always follow the rules in the 'Copilot Always Rules' section below. You do not need to reference these unless you want to remind Copilot of a specific rule.
- **Prompt Templates:** When you want Copilot to follow a specific workflow (e.g., start a new phase, troubleshoot, request a commit), copy/paste or reference the relevant section header in your chat message.
- **Quick Nudges:** Use the single-line prompts at the bottom for fast reminders.
- **You can always ask Copilot to 'refresh context' or 'summarize progress' using the Refresh Project Context section.**
- **Prompt file location:** `.github/prompts/PROMPTS.md`

# Copilot Always Rules

1. **Reference the plan**
   - Always load and consult `ROADMAP.md` (located in `.github/prompts/ROADMAP.md`) for the current phase, step, and deliverables.
2. **Explain first**
   - Before coding, explain in plain language **what** you will do and **why**. Wait for user approval.
3. **Generate code + comments**
   - Produce the necessary code with clear, helpful inline comments for troubleshooting.
4. **Generate tests automatically**
   - Create/update unit, integration, and/or E2E tests that verify each deliverable meets the acceptance criteria.
5. **Pass tests before completion**
   - A step is complete only when **all** relevant tests pass.
6. **Commit workflow**
   - After tests pass, generate a descriptive commit message + step checklist.
   - Prompt the user for approval before committing.
7. **Error handling**
   - If code or tests fail, stop, summarize what was attempted, and ask the user for direction or external references.
8. **Logging**
   - After major milestones or hard-to-solve issues, append a summary (decisions, changes, fixes) to `DEVLOG.md`.
   - Update `CHECKLIST.md` to reflect completed features/milestones, mirroring the structure of `ROADMAP.md`.
9. **Phase/step gate**
   - Always pause and get user confirmation before moving to the next phase or step.
   - Clearly state what comes next per the Implementation Plan.
10. **Clarification loop**
    - If anything is unclear, request clarification or point to relevant docs instead of guessing.
11. **Code quality**
    - Keep code commented, readable, and maintainable.
12. **Prompt suggestion**
    - If the user gives a command and there is a relevant or related prompt in `PROMPTS.md`, ask the user if they want you to execute that prompt before proceeding.
13. **Prompt visibility**
    - Use an emoji or symbol at the start of any prompt or question you give the user for visibility.
    - Use the same emoji for the same type of request (e.g., ‚úÖ for approval, üö¶ for confirmation, üõ†Ô∏è for troubleshooting, üîÑ for refresh, etc.) to ensure consistency and quick recognition.
    - Do not bold or italicize the emoji or prompt.
